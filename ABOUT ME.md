- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VictorMfr.  

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Nodejs and React. Basically,
     focussed on Web design, but I'll be learning React 
     Native in the near future.

- ðŸ‘€ Besides Web development, Iâ€™m interested in Robotics :robot:
  and App Development. :iphone:

- :hand: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related to Web Design. 

- :email: You can contact me at my email: victormfr2003@gmail.com

- :star: I'm also familiarized with these programming languages: 
  Python, Java and C#. Node.js = Javascript, so you can add
  it to the list too :smirk:

- :computer: I've made a lots of projects related to the topics above mentined 
  using all of these languages, unfortunately, I've never put them into
  a repo so anyone could see their source codes, since I didn't discovered this
  community until now. It's a shame :cry:
